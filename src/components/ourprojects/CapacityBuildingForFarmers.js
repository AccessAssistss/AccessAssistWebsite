            We are empowering farmers through the development of a comprehensive farm app with our partner. To ensure effective onboarding, weâ€™ve produced engaging videos that demonstrate the value of this digital platform. As the App offers essential advisory services, including crop recommendations tailored to local conditions, climate adaptation tips, and access to soil testing services, in our videos Ram Charan helps his friend, Nand Lal to understand the various benefits of being associated with the App. By equipping farmers with this knowledge, we aim to enhance their decision-making capabilities and increase productivity, enabling them to harness the benefits of modern agriculture technologies.
