          ASSIST was commissioned to undertake a diagnostic for climate financing for an NBFC in India where it conducted a comprehensive analysis of the NBFCâ€™s loan portfolio (exceeding INR 2,500 cr), and scrutinized their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policy to assess its alignment with industry best practices. 
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Engaging in in-depth interviews with senior leadership, ASSIST explored demand dynamics and strategic priorities within the organisation.

          <p class="font-semibold leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Additionally, it also undertook a detailed examination of over 20 business clusters, analysing their respective data and financial metrics. This multifaceted approach enabled the organisation to gain insights into the existing portfolio performance and identify opportunities for enhancing climate financing initiatives, thereby positioning the NBFC for sustainable growth in a rapidly evolving market landscape.

            As part of this diagnostic process, ASSIST engaged with over 480
            branches across India to identify the scope for climate financing.
            Our team meticulously studied the specific clusters served by each
            branch, conducting in-depth interviews and discussions with branch
            managers and staff to gain insights into the local market dynamics
            and customer needs.

              Following this analysis, ASSIST developed targeted product
              interventions tailored to the specific needs of the NBFC and
              provided market estimates for each proposed product, ensuring they
              align with prevailing market conditions. To facilitate
              decision-making, a product viability assessment framework, which
              rated how well each product would perform within their lending
              offerings, was also implemented. This comprehensive approach
              positions the NBFC to effectively leverage its strengths and
              capitalise on emerging opportunities in the climate finance
              sector.
