        ASSIST undertook a sector landscaping for an international entrepreneurial bank, FMO Netherlands, on climate finance

        The landscaping, covered in a commissioned report, provided a holistic view of climate finance and catalytic funding in India from a microfinance standpoint. ASSIST examined challenges, opportunities, policies, and product interventions in climate financing for individuals, households, and MSMEs across India. Additionally, ASSIST identified potential opportunities for green financing from an MFIâ€™s perspective, helping drive sustainable development and financial inclusion.
